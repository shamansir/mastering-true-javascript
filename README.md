Mastering True Javascript
-------------------------

Here I plan to store the examples / short excerpts from Mastering True Javascript lecture.

You may clone it, [participate in it at Cloud 9 IDE](https://c9.io/shamansir/mastering-true-javascript), view it â€” do everything you want.

But currently, there is nothing inside. See you later :)

Sincerely yours, `shaman.sir` :)
